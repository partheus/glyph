<p class="post-description">non fiction</p>

<div class="post-content">
  <p>It usually takes a very specific kind of event to leave the imprint of a memorable sorrow on one's mind. Or, a specific kind of <em>person</em>.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>In my own experiments with the middle ether, it has been brought forth that grief that stems from any form of unexplicable love is a particularly agonizing kind.</p>
<p>In his book <em>Meditations</em>, Marcus Aurelius writes: &quot;If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.&quot;</p>
<p>What of the silent and gentle shattering of an experimental heart, much like a Fabergé egg that has found itself in the middle of a clumsy heist? What would you have me do then, Marcus? Do a silly jig, maybe?</p>
<p>Friends of mine who are more <strong>beach folk</strong> than <strong>city folk</strong> sometimes talk about things like grief in the form of waves. &quot;Let it wash over you,&quot; they say. &quot;Let it wash over you, and then let it go.&quot;</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I have been trying to let it wash over me, but it seems to be stuck in my hair. I have been trying to let it go, but it seems to be stuck in my throat. It's in my skin, sometimes, not even <em>under</em> it. The air I breathe appears to be steeped in the very thing, dense and foggy.</p>
<p>Nice waves, though. Sure. Sure, Marcus. Thanks.</p>
<p>If only there was a little <em>meaning</em> to some of these things, it would be a simple matter of placing it in a faraway room in the memory palace.</p>
<p>But it is not so. It is not so, and the waves keep coming. That's fine. I'm learning to swim.</p>
