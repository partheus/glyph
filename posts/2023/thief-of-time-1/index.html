<div class="post-content">
  <p>The creation of a memory can be a very delicate thing. It is a process that requires a certain kind of care, a certan whimsy, certain people to be involved in it.</p>
<p>A person who inserts herself into a delicate memory is a sinister villain. A thief of time.</p>
<p>On the weekend she stole three memories from me. Whisked them away like they were eggs of gold, almost like she was a beautiful Parisian miscreant, her presence ethereal in more ways than one. She was.</p>
<p>Every few weeks she appears out of thin air, the wind shifting her hair like a jealous lover, the twinkle in her eyes unwavering, her fingers grasping at my arms. It must all feel so much fun to her. She is a thief of time, and I am a willing victim. A first-class fool.</p>
<p>This thievery has occurred ever since I met her, which was immediately after learning how to form a more permanent memory than just remembering to say &quot;da-da&quot;. Not a single time I have complained. Not a single time will I complain.</p>
<p>She appeared first like a dream, the scent of nightmare following her like a shadow. 1893. I was in a small town in the middle of nowhere, and she was in a small town in the middle of nowhere. We were inside the same dream.</p>
<p>Ah, 1893. The year of the Chicago World's Fair. The year of the first driving license issuance. The year of the first time I saw her.</p>
<p>The year it all went to shit.</p>
