Linear time is one of the worst inventions of our waking mind. Whatever the hell goes on in the middle of these things is 1. not only an affront to the unregistered time-travellers of the lower hemisphere, but also 2. it is the very root cause of simple anguish.

Whatever.

One of the only ways to maybe even begin to perceive most of time as non-linear involves a profound refactoring of one's mind. Not that I would know how to do any of that, but it seems like a good starting point. What do I know.

Someone should invent a time bubble of sorts. Now that could be fun.
