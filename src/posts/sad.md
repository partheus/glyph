I am standing atop a bed of shifting sands.

The wind is cold, the sun has set.

I am alone.

I am alone, and I am sad.

I'm drowning in an indescribable grief. In 2022 and 2023 I spent many hours figuring out my relationship with my own mind. In fact, I am great friends with the little grey cells, mon ami. But the sadness is still here.

But the sadness is still here. 

But the sadness is still here.
