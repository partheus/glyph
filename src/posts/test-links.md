# Links in Markdown

Here are some examples of different types of links in Markdown:

## Inline Links

2. [OpenAI](https://www.openai.com)
3. [GitHub](https://github.com)

## Reference Links

You can also use reference links:

## External Links with Titles

You can add titles to links for additional information:

- [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com "Search the web privately")
- [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org "The Free Encyclopedia")

## Email Links

To create an email link, use the `mailto:` scheme:

- [Send Email](mailto:your.email@example.com)

## Anchor Links

You can create anchor links within the same document:

- [Jump to Section 1](#section-1)
- [Jump to Section 2](#section-2)

## Footnote Links

Footnote links can be helpful for adding additional information:

Here's a sentence with a footnote[^1].

[^1]: This is the footnote text.

## Auto-Linked URLs

URLs are automatically converted into links:

- https://www.example.com
- https://www.markdownguide.org

## Relative Links

Relative links are used within the same website or project:

- [About Us](/about)
- [Contact](/contact)

## Image Links

You can also create links to images:

![GitHub Logo](https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png)

## External Images with Titles

- ![Markdown Logo](https://www.markdownguide.org/images/markdown-guide-logo.png "Markdown Guide Logo")
- ![OpenAI](https://www.openai.com/static/images/logos/logo-openai-brown.png "OpenAI Logo")

Please note that not all Markdown processors support every type of link. The above examples should work in most common Markdown rendering environments.
