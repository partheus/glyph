I think Brian Freeman's take on the Jason Bourne book series[^1] is a refreshing one. Although the story kind of drops the reader into the new Bourne canon, it's evident that Freeman know's what he's doing, and maybe there will be a filler connector short story or another book to connect the Bourne storylines.

Jason Bourne is one my own favorite "broken hero" trope characters, and I must admit that he was one of the few I read very very early on in my reading life, when I was too young to be reading about amnesiac spies and assassins. I think I read the first three books in the series, and then I stopped.

I'm glad he's back!
