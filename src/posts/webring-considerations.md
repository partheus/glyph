title: Webring Considerations

If you search up the keyword `webring` on Github or any other repo hosting platform, you'll see that there are certain kinds of webrings that are more diagonal than others.

I will not elaborate, but there are different vibes to different webrings, obviously. The trick is to ponder them neutrally.

I have been part of a webring only once, a long time ago, in another galaxy.

Hopefully I can be part of one again, soon!
