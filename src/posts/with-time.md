I haven't written on this site for a while; I've been super busy feeling many, many things. I've had the fortune of leading a very happening and adventurous life, and it all comes and goes in waves.

I'm afraid of swimming.

Places and people that have made several marks on me still swim in my waking mind. I've been thinking about the past and the future quite a bit, and sometimes it takes away from learning to live in the present. I must somehow learn to live in the present.

I have to be here, now. I have to stay here. Now.

The future will sort itself out. The past is gone. I have to be here, now. I have to stay.

I will stay.

Perhaps the meaning of all these tribulations will come to me with time. I will learn to swim again, competitively, like I used to as a wee lad.

For now, though, I will stay.
