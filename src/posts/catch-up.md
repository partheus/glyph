Eventually everything will turn to dust, and everyone will be asleep, and the soft hum of the universe will fade away.

Now, though, a mountain calls to an adventurer across the world, a young monk whispers to a friend the secrets of attachment, a dolphin dives into the ocean not knowing what it will find.

There are rare objects in strange places, and the inverse is also true. I forgot all about this website as I began to figure out who I really am, but that's chill.

Questing is so exhausting and fun, and I'm glad to be back.
