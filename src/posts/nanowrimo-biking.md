## Biking in the rain


I love biking so much I'm going to create a tabular data visualizer for the main site at some point.

George Benson's "Breezin'" is playing on my headphones, but not really, just inside my head, which is awesome.

> Whatever the hell happened to webrings????

I spent so much time looking at webrings the other day I'm pretty sure a fragment of some webrings is embedded in my mind by now. No worries.
