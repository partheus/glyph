It usually takes a very specific kind of event to leave the imprint of a memorable sorrow on one's mind. Or, a specific kind of _person_.

Well.

In my own experiments with the middle ether, it has been brought forth that grief that stems from any form of unexplicable love is a particularly agonizing kind.

In his book _Meditations_, Marcus Aurelius writes: "If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment."

What of the silent and gentle shattering of an experimental heart, much like a Faberg√© egg that has found itself in the middle of a clumsy heist? What would you have me do then, Marcus? Do a silly jig, maybe?

Friends of mine who are more **beach folk** than **city folk** sometimes talk about things like grief in the form of waves. "Let it wash over you," they say. "Let it wash over you, and then let it go."

Okay.

I have been trying to let it wash over me, but it seems to be stuck in my hair. I have been trying to let it go, but it seems to be stuck in my throat. It's in my skin, sometimes, not even _under_ it. The air I breathe appears to be steeped in the very thing, dense and foggy.

Nice waves, though. Sure. Sure, Marcus. Thanks.

If only there was a little _meaning_ to some of these things, it would be a simple matter of placing it in a faraway room in the memory palace. 

But it is not so. It is not so, and the waves keep coming. That's fine. I'm learning to swim.
