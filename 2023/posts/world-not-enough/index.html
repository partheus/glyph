        <h2>The World is Not Enough</h2>
<p class="post-description">Orbis non sufficit. kafkaesque.</p>
---
<div class="post-content">
  <p>Ian Fleming wrote about James Bond as this dashing adventurer. I imagine there is a lot of truth to the lies that Bond heard from the lips of Vesper Lynd.</p>
<p>In Latin, <em>Orbis Non Sufficit</em> literally translates to &quot;The World is Not Enough&quot; and is the motto of the Bond family<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>A special fictitious design for the coat of arms was introduced for the series<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>There are other references to how this whole thing came about as well<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>So. What does the world not being enough have to do with me? At this time? Hmm.</p>
<p><em>A</em> world is not enough. I am in a unique situation wherein I have to lead a sort of double life. I can only wish it was as colorful and as swashbuckl-ey as mister Bond's. The two worlds that I inhabit have long since been slightly at odds with one another. I cannot go into details for obvious and [redacted] reasons.</p>
<p>Exactly <em>how</em> these worlds came to be, or even how, as the atom splits, my world was split into two, is something that was outside of my volition. Mostly. What's done is already done.</p>
<p>The same way this world adopted me warmly, the other world did as well. I am grateful for both. But the <em>choice</em> factor, oh, this world or that world. Excruciating. I sometimes wish the choice factor wasn't up to me.</p>
<p>Traveling between the two worlds is a most peculiar feeling. It's not unnatural to think of the world that I was born into as <strong>home</strong>, but then the same can apply to the world I later built and stepped into on my own accord. How do people navigate the Kafkaesque subtleties of this situation?</p>
<p>How do <em>I</em> navigate the Kafkaesque subtleties of this situation? Time will tell. I hope it talks to me soon.</p>
